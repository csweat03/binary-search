# Binary Search

This is an implementation of a Binary Search algorithm in Java 17, this saves time by converting linear searches [ o(N) ] to a binary search [ o( log N ) ]. This project is built using Gradle. JUnit 5 is a dependancy. Test cases are in BinarySearchTest.java

## Lessons Learned

Learned how efficient modern computers were, I had to simulate a linear search on 250,000,000 integers in an array 
to observe a 100ms difference between linear search and binary search. I learned the improvements between these 2 
search algorithms and where each could be used best.
